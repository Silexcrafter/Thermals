This program transforms raw data into a list of points in 3D.
The data is stored in an ascii text format called IGC.

IGC points are stored in this way: B1006384853974N00420818EA-00190009200000
the record must start with "B"
the first 6 digits are the time in utc of the record "100638" in this example
the next 7 digits are the x coordinate "4853974"
the following letter codes the hemisphere N or S


the x coordinate is 00420818E (?)
the y coordinate is 4853974N
