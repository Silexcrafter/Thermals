Solve the intersect problem for every [n;n+2] segments. Print only the intersections of segments not straight line.
[n;n+1] segments intersect at the extremity of n segment so that's useless.




Let A,B,C,D be 2-space position vectors.  Then the directed line
    segments AB & CD are given by:

        AB=A+r(B-A), r in [0,1]
        CD=C+s(D-C), s in [0,1]

    If AB & CD intersect, then

        A+r(B-A)=C+s(D-C), or

        Ax+r(Bx-Ax)=Cx+s(Dx-Cx)
        Ay+r(By-Ay)=Cy+s(Dy-Cy)  for some r,s in [0,1]

    Solving the above for r and s yields

            (Ay-Cy)(Dx-Cx)-(Ax-Cx)(Dy-Cy)
        r = -----------------------------  (eqn 1)
            (Bx-Ax)(Dy-Cy)-(By-Ay)(Dx-Cx)

            (Ay-Cy)(Bx-Ax)-(Ax-Cx)(By-Ay)
        s = -----------------------------  (eqn 2)
            (Bx-Ax)(Dy-Cy)-(By-Ay)(Dx-Cx)

    Let P be the position vector of the intersection point, then

        P=A+r(B-A) or

        Px=Ax+r(Bx-Ax)
        Py=Ay+r(By-Ay)

    By examining the values of r & s, you can also determine some
    other limiting conditions:

        If 0<=r<=1 & 0<=s<=1, intersection exists
            r<0 or r>1 or s<0 or s>1 line segments do not intersect

        If the denominator in eqn 1 is zero, AB & CD are parallel
        If the numerator in eqn 1 is also zero, AB & CD are collinear.

    If they are collinear, then the segments may be projected to the x- 
    or y-axis, and overlap of the projected intervals checked.

    If the intersection point of the 2 lines are needed (lines in this
    context mean infinite lines) regardless whether the two line
    segments intersect, then

        If r>1, P is located on extension of AB
        If r<0, P is located on extension of BA
        If s>1, P is located on extension of CD
        If s<0, P is located on extension of DC

    Also note that the denominators of eqn 1 & 2 are identical.
