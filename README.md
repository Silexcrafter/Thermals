# Thermals
a tool to compute thermals location from gliders data

Many glider pilots record their flight with a gps logger and publish it on a website such as netcoupe.com to compare their flights. This program aims to take advantage of the huge mass of data available in this website to determine the most likely location of thermals during a flight thus improving overall performance.
